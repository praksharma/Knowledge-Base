    "# Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modes\n",
    "Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) is the study of how a conducting fluid (plasma) interacts with magnetic fields.\n",

    "In MHD, plasma behavior is decomposed into eigenmodes, which represent different instability structures or wave patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{warning}\n",
    "Not to be confused with [MHD wave modes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetohydrodynamics#Waves) are linear perturbations that propagate in a magnetized plasma. However they have a common mode called **Alfv√©n wave**.\n",

    "## MHD instabilities\n",
    "MHD instabilities are large-scale deformations that grows over time resulting in degraded performance or lead to disruptions. They are derived from the nonlinear MHD equations and often lead to plasma disruptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analogy with singular value decomposition\n",
    "In SVD, a signal or dataset is decomposed into orthogonal modes ranked by singular values (importance). However, SVD is purely data-driven and does not leverage physics equations.\n",

    "In MHD, plasma behavior is decomposed into eigenmodes, which represent different instability structures or wave patterns. MHD modes come from solving plasma physics equations and are not data-driven.\n",
