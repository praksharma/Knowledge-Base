    "## Introduction\n",
    "* Plasma discharges in tokamaks currently suffer from plasma disruptions, or loss of plasma stability.\n",
    "* Disruptions deposit large amounts of heat and stress loads on the plasma facing components (PFCs), reducing their lifetime.\n",
    "* Disruption arises from heterogeneous causes. Meaning they don't always arise from the same sequence of events, or the there is no single cause for disruptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disruption can be caused by:\n",
    "* MHD instabilities like tearing modes or vertical displacement events (VDEs)\n",
    "* Operational limits being exceeded (density, current, etc.)\n",
    "* Hardware issues or control system failures,\n",
    "* Or combinations of minor effects stacking up over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use ML models to predict disruption while a discharge is going on. The model should give us enough time to carry out mitigation steps to control further damage. Here are different ways mitigation approaches:\n",
    "* Injection of nobel gases such as Neon or Argon, which reduces the thermal loads.\n",
    "* Firing a pellet of frozen hydrogen to cool the plasma.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of the paper is:\n",
    "* Real time, generalised model for disruption prediction.\n",
    "* Model comparison. They are comparing different models to see which one is the best.\n",
    "    * Top model had a AUC of 0.97 and F2 score of 0.89.\n",
    "* Exploratory Insights: \n",
    "    * sample rate dependence. Some models use use them and some don't.\n",
    "    * Long term memory: Except transformers, all models have some form of long term memory and limited data context.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Long term problems\n",
    "* Using probabilistic models to gain a better theoretical understanding of the tokamak plasma dynamics.\n",
    "* Uncovering causal mechanisms behind the tokamak plasma dynamics including those leading to disruptions.\n",
    "* Moving from prediction to control : building systems that not only shut down a plasma discharge, but prolong and continue its progress while avoiding disruption."

    "## Problems with existing ML techniques\n",
    "* Evaluation approches are not standardised.\n",
    "    * Some papers use an end of discharge AUC classification.\n",
    "    * Some use hysteresis type evaluation but have not made their code public.\n",
    "* State-of-the-art systems are not accurate enough for real world use-cases.\n",
    "    * Most of them reach 90% True Positive Rate (TPR).\n",
    "    * Next generation devices will require models to reach 95% TPR at a 5% FPR.\n",
    "* Models are not tested across multiple tokamaks.\n",
    "    * Simply because data is not available.\n",
    "    * Lack of zero shot transfer learning.\n",
    "    * state of the art models drop to ∼77% TPR at 5% FPR when considering zero-shot transfer metrics.\n",
    "* Prior models are dependent on a tokamak’s unique sampling rate.\n",
    "    * This is due to the use of different diagnostic systems.\n",
    "* The memory within a tokamak plasma is poorly understood.\n",
    "    * how much data context should we explicitly show our models when asking them to make decisions about a plasma state seconds away from its start.\n",

    "* High threshold: If the predicted disruption probability is above this, a \"warning\" is triggered.\n",
    "* Low threshold: If the prediction falls below this, the warning is cleared.\n",
    "* Hysteresis: Helps avoid frequent on-off toggling — the model must sustain high probability for several steps before declaring a disruption.\n",
