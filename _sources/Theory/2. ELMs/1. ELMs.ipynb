    "## Plasma instability\n",
    "Plasma instability refers to any disturbance or fluctuation in a plasma that grows over time and disrupts its equilibrium or ordered behavior. Instabilities can be driven by:\n",
    "* Current (e.g., too much current through the plasma column)\n",
    "* Pressure gradients (e.g., high pressure in the core vs. edge)\n",
    "* Magnetic field configuration (e.g., twisted field lines or bad confinement geometry)\n",
    "* Plasma rotation or flow (e.g., velocity shear)\n",
    "\n",
    "## L-mode (Low-confinement mode)\n",
    "* Default state of plasma when it's first heated and confined.\n",
    "* Energy and particles are lost quickly, especially at the edge of the plasma.\n",
    "* Lower plasma temperature and pressure.\n",
    "* Easier to maintain but not suitable for sustained fusion because of poor energy confinement.\n",
    "\n",
    "## H-mode (High-confinement mode)\n",
    "* Discovered in 1982 at ASDEX (Germany).\n",
    "* Achieved when input power crosses a threshold.\n",
    "* Plasma forms a transport barrier at the edge, called the edge pedestal.\n",
    "* This barrier reduces turbulence, and confinement improves sharply.\n",
    "* Higher temperature, pressure, and density at the core. essential for efficient fusion."

    "* This is a nonlinear, sudden change (like a phase transition).\n",
    "* H-mode is more unstable, prone to ELMs (Edge Localized Modes), which are mini-explosions at the edge that can damage reactor walls.\n",

    "* Between ~800 and ~1200: The regular spikes in the Dα signal indicates ELM.\n",
