    "# Magnetic confinement\n",
    "\n",
    "Fusion reactions require temperatures of 50-150 millions degree celsius temperature. No material can withstand direct contact with plasma at these temperatures without melting or vaporizing. Even the most heat-resistant materials, like tungsten, would fail almost instantly. Magnetic confinement allows containing the plasma without direct contact with a solid body. This is possible because plasma is an ionized gas, and therefore it is affected by magnetic fields.\n",

    "The following plot is taken from COMPASS Tokamak, operational in 1990s in the UKAEA. The plot is called a magnetic instability spectrum. On the x-axis time is measured in milliseconds (ms), showing how the plasma behavior evolves. One the y-axis, frequency of magnetic fluctuations is shown in kilohertz (kHz), representing oscillations in the magnetic field. The Red/yellow colour denotes strong magnetic activity or instabilities. See this plot as a scatter plot with a colormap not as a standard 2D plot.\n",

The black lines are magnetic flux surfaces, which describe the shape and position of the plasma within the reactor. Ideally, these surfaces are well-contained and concentric, staying centered in the reactor.\n",
