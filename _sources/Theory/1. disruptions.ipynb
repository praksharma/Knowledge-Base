    "Fusion reactions require temperatures of 50-150 millions degree celsius temperature. No material can withstand direct contact with plasma at these temperatures without melting or vaporizing. Even the most heat-resistant materials, like tungsten, would fail almost instantly. Magnetic confinement allows containing the plasma without direct contact with a solid body. This is possible because plasma is an ionized gas, and therefore it is affected by magnetic fields."
