    "Fusion reactions require temperatures of 50-150 millions degree celsius temperature. No material can withstand direct contact with plasma at these temperatures without melting or vaporizing. Even the most heat-resistant materials, like tungsten, would fail almost instantly. Magnetic confinement allows containing the plasma without direct contact with a solid body. This is possible because plasma is an ionized gas, and therefore it is affected by magnetic fields.\n",

On the x-axis time is measured in milliseconds (ms), showing how the plasma behavior evolves. One the y-axis, frequency of magnetic fluctuations is shown in kilohertz (kHz), representing oscillations in the magnetic field. The Red/yellow colour denotes strong magnetic activity or instabilities. See this plot as a scatter plot with a colormap not as a standard 2D plot.\n",
