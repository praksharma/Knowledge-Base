Different types of RNNs use different ways to update the state, for example, Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU).The state is a cell, with gates like input, forgot and output. The input gate decides what information to store in the cell, the forget gate decides what information to throw away from the cell and the output gate decides what information to output from the cell.\n",
